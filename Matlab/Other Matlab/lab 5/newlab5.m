% What deduction can you obtain from the simulations using K_p and K_p2?
% Explain this from the points of the steady-state error,
%e_ss, as well as
% the overall responses of the system, 1.. overshoot, oscillations, faster
% slower responses in terms
% settling time, Ts,
% Record this discussion in your Log Book Â»

SECTION 3
% Determine by hand calculations, using Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion,
% the value of K that will produce a marginally stable response for the
% CLTF.

% *Hint: Refer to Tutorial 6.

% Record all hand calculations in your Log Book.
% Uncomment, i.e. remove the & signs at the beginning of the codes below
%after you have solved the Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion calculations
% exercise.

K_U = 35 % Update K value with the one obtained via calculations
name = sprintf( 'Unit step response with Ku = 8.2f', K_u );
plotCLTF( K_U, G, name ); % Unit step response of the CLTF with K as Ultimate Gain

% From this new unit step response plot, ensure that the closed-loop system
% is marginally stable (sustained oscillations)
%Determine the period of oscillations, Tu, from the plot. You can use the
% Data Cursor button on your plot window,
%shown in Figure 3, to place
%markers on strategic locations on the graph line, e.g. peaks, to know
%specific values of time. You can place more than one data marker

%SECTION 4
% Assume now that the system 15 controlled using a PID controller as shown
% in Figure 2 in the practical manual.
% usino the values of Ku and Tu, employ the Ziegler-Nichols Continuous
%@velina Method to deston the kl
%Ti, and Td parameters for a PID
%controller
%Record all hand calculations in your Log boox.**
%Hint: Ziegler-Nichols Continuous Cycling Method Table can be found in
%Lecture 7 Controllers.
